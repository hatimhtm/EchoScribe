# Automated Meeting Transcription and Summary

This Python script automates the process of recording, transcribing, and summarizing meetings. It uses the Slack API to detect the start and end of a meeting, records the audio, transcribes the audio into text, and summarizes the key points. The summary is then posted to a designated Slack channel.

## Features

- **Meeting Detection**: Uses the Slack API to detect when a meeting starts and ends.
- **Audio Recording**: Records the audio of the meeting.
- **Transcription**: Transcribes the audio into text using the Google Speech-to-Text API.
- **Summary**: Summarizes the transcription and extracts tasks and notes using the OpenAI GPT-3 model.
- **Posting to Slack**: Posts the summary to a Slack channel.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the Google Cloud SDK and authenticate with Google Cloud.
4. Set up a Slack app and install it in your workspace.
5. Set the following environment variables:

    - `SLACK_API_TOKEN`: Your Slack API token.
    - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: The path to your Google Cloud service account key file.

## Usage

Run the script with Python:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will start monitoring for meetings. When a meeting starts, it will start recording the audio. When the meeting ends, it will transcribe the audio, summarize the transcription, and post the summary to the Slack channel.
